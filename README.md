Programming Advanced - 01.2023

https://softuni.bg/trainings/3963/python-advanced-january-2023

The Python Advanced course builds on Python language skills by exploring more complex concepts typical of the language. In the course you will learn to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with stacks and queues (Stacks & Queues), tuples and sets (Tuples & Sets), matrices (Multidimensional Lists), as well and files and directories. Attention will be paid to the functional programming paradigm. You will take a deeper look at recursive functions and functions with multiple arguments. The development environment that will be used by the training team is PyCharm, but each trainee is free to use tools of preference.
